# 📦 Supply Chain Analytics Project

An end-to-end data analytics project to analyze and improve shipment performance in an e-commerce supply chain using **Excel**, **Python**, **SQL**, **Power BI**, and **AI-assisted prompting**.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This project investigates shipment delivery behavior and root causes of delays in a supply chain network. The goal is to derive actionable insights to improve **on-time delivery**, **warehouse performance**, and **overall customer satisfaction**.

We analyze multiple perspectives using:

- Monthly shipment trends  
- Product importance & delivery issues  
- Warehouse-level performance  
- Return rates based on customer satisfaction  

*Prompting techniques (ChatGPT) were used throughout the project to accelerate coding, improve SQL logic, and streamline analysis workflows across tools.*
